== PushVendor

This is a point of sale built with Rails and Twitter Bootstrap. It is still very early in development but will soon be a full featured cloud based, point of sale.

There is no save button for making sales. All updates are made via AJAX. I wanted to simulate desktop application behaviour and not reload the page for every action but I also didn't want to rely on Javascript too much, as I did in the prototype. Using AJAX posts, I am able to use the server for calculations and then reload the relevent section on a successful callback. Using ruby instead of JS for calculations makes the system less suseptable to browser and system differences.
